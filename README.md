# Web-Development-with-XML-CSS-HTML
This SPSCC coursework team project I worked on is a webpage displaying a list of programming languages and their functions, built using XML, CSS, and HTML, with an intuitive and visually appealing design using CSS. XML is used as the data source and HTML to display the information for a great starting point in web development.
